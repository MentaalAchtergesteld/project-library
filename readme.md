# Welcome!

It seems you have found yourself in a very dark place in life, to be wandering around these places.
Since i keep coming up with ideas for projects, and then work on them for 3 minutes because else i'll forget, i've decided to create this project manager to keep track of all these ideas.

Current project scope includes:

- A list view of all projects.
- A detailed view of each project, including things like a description.
- Status for each project, like Finished, In Progress, Paused or when it's just an Idea.
- Of course, adding and removing projects.
- Saving these projects to a human readable TOML file.
- Not much more for now cause i'll probably abandon this project as well.

Feel free to cry, talk to a therapist, or whatever other coping mechanism you might have after you've read this code and maybe even used the project if you dared.
That's about all i have to say about this mess
